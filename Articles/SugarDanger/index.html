		<h2 class="title">The Danger of Sugar</h2>

		<p class="border">
			Figuring out what the most optimal eating regiment
			requires, has been a topic that has captivated the United States for as long
			 as food has been convenient. In fact 80 percent of American adults are conscious
			  of their weight and what they eat (Calorie Control Council, 2010). It's hard to
				believe that even though most Americans are health conscious, the rate of
				obesity is still soaring. The primary cause for the unrelenting health epidemic
				in the United States is directly linked to the sugar industry and its foul
				practices. High-fructose corn syrup is the main game piece in the sugar
				industry's manipulative game of profit; a game in which the everyday citizen
				is unknowingly subjected to poison. Defending itself, the sugar industry
				throws its money into public relations and countless invalid research studies
				in an attempt to clear the foul stigma surrounding their product. Unfortunately
				for the citizens of the United States, the sugar industry has done exceedingly
				well in their endeavors to retain profits. In order to prevent further harm to
				the fine populace of the Unites States, an initiative to inform about the
				danger of the sugar industry must commence.
			</p>

		<p>
			It must be mentioned however, that there is some validity in the claim that
			 High-fructose corn syrup is a product of chemical similarity to natural sugar.
			  Table sugar, or sucrose, is comprised of 50 percent glucose and 50 percent
				 fructose (About High Fructose Corn Syrup). Correspondingly, High-fructose
				 corn syrup is comprised of either; 45 percent glucose and 55 percent fructose,
				 or 58 percent glucose and 42 percent fructose (About High Fructose Corn Syrup).
				 Caloric properties are also identical, with each substance containing 4
				 calories per gram (About High Fructose Corn Syrup). The Corn Refiners
				 Association's claim that High-fructose corn syrup is a safe product,
				 rests upon the questionable assumption that little differences in chemical
				  composition do not alter the properties of a product; this assumption is
					anything but accurate. Take for example the human genome; if there is
					 one extra chromosome inscribed into the DNA of a developing baby, the
					  baby will have a condition called "Down Syndrome." Quantifiably a one
						chromosome variation is extremely minute, yet the effects are detrimental.
						So why would the Corn Refiners Association, and the sugar industry,
						seek to deceive consumers? Generally, it all boils down to the money
						 in their pockets. If the consumer is unaware of the hazard, then they
						  are more likely to continue buying products that contain high-fructose corn syrup.
		</p>

		<p>
			Throughout the history of the sugar industry's existence, deception has been
			their greatest ally. The sugar industry has a whole department devoted to the
			 manipulation of their consumer perceived identity; corporations call this
			  department "Public Relations." The Sugar industry's public relations department
				 has been using tactics that are eerily similar to that of what the tobacco
				 industry has used (Huff et al. 71). Beginning in the 1970's, the sugar
				 industry has implemented sponsored research, censorship, and bribes in
				 order to maintain its profits. Scientific research seems like it would
				 be a great way to solve this whole dilemma, however all scientific research
				  is not created equal. According to Kelly Crowe, researchers hired by
					the sugar industry received money from big name companies including;
					Coca-Cola, Hershey, General Foods, General Mills and Nabisco (2013).
					Seeking to keep a good image for their sugary products, these companies
					 each donated $10,000 (Crowe, 2013). It is safe to assume that the conclusions
					  provided from these researchers were influenced by the large amounts
						 of money they received. In other words, researchers were bribed to
						 produce outcomes in favor of the sugar industry's profit. Alas, the
						 deception does not stop with invalid research. Censorship of the
						  media is one of the tools the sugar industry uses to retain a favorable
							image. During the 1970's, and even today, the sugar industry would
							forcefully attack anyone who intended to inform the public on the
							dangers of sugar (Crowe, 2013). In replacement of the media that the
							industry censored, they implemented misinformation tactics. A specific
							example included in Kelly Crowe's article, shows a 1970's television
							ad in which sugar was depicted as a healthier alternative to an apple,
							and that consuming high amounts of sugar before dinner would prevent
							overeating (2013). Common sense tells us that this is absolutely false,
							but in the 1970's it fooled many unsuspecting consumers. Unfortunately
							the spread of misinformation has not come to an end; although it is not
							as blatantly false as in the 1970's. Today there is a campaign being run
							by the Corn Refiners Association. A simple Google search with anything
							related to high-fructose corn syrup, will present a sponsored link that
							leads to a website in which misinformation is exhibited. On most of the
							websites that are sponsored by the Corn Refiners Association, it is stated
							that High-fructose corn syrup is a natural product. High-fructose corn syrup
							is not a natural product; a more in depth analysis will be presented in the
							coming pages of this essay. The Corn Refiners Association also claims that
							high-fructose corn syrup is safe; again this statement is not accurate.
							After these websites lull the consumer into their web of lies, it then lists
							several industrial advantages to high-fructose corn syrup. They list advantages
							such as; helps mouth feel, browns baked goods, use as a preservative,
							retains moisture, and controls boiling and melting points (About High
							Fructose Corn Syrup). It is obvious that the Corn Refiners Association is
							only interested in securing profits, and will spread lies about health
							concerns to do so. According to Gary Taubes and Cristen Couzens, the sugar
							industry spent approximately 3.4 million dollars (in today's money) on
							public relations annually during the 1970's (2012). If the sugar industry
							did not have anything to hide, why would they spend such a great deal of
							money? Thinking logically here, the sugar industry will do anything to
							secure its profits; which means that the 3.4 million dollars that was
							spent on public relations was a decision that had a greater benefit than
							it did a cost. In fact, the decision to spend millions of dollars on
							deception earned the Sugar Association the Silver Anvil; a public relations
							award (Crowe, 2013). Furthermore, the sugar lobby has pressured the government
							to remain neutral regarding sugar regulations. Andy Briscoe, the head of
							the Sugar Association and sugar lobby, wrote to the advisory committee
							attempting to persuade them that sugar is not the cause of health problems
							(Milbank, 2015). As absurd as it sounds, this technique used by the sugar
							lobby actually works on government organizations. The one safe-guard that
							consumers have is tainted by the sugar lobby's efforts. Another example of
							the sugar lobby's foul agenda occurred in 2003. In 2003 the World Health
							Organization (WHO) was scheduled to release a report on health strategies,
							which included lowering sugar consumption (Huff, 71). In response the proposed
							release of the report, the Sugar Association threatened  to, "exercise every
							avenue available . . . including asking congressional appropriators to challenge
							future [WHO] funding" (Huff et al. 71). It seems as though the sugar industry
							black-mailed the World Health Organization. Seeing as how black-mailing is a
							federal offense, there is no limit to what the sugar industry will do to secure
							its profits. In summary, the sugar industry uses; tainted reports from "in company"
							researchers, censorship of the media, ad campaigns, and lobbyist tactics to maintain a
							positive public image. So why is it that the sugar industry is putting forth a substantial
							effort in public relations? It is almost as if they are trying to hide something.

			Sugar has been scientifically researched for a considerable time now, and the
			evidence proving how dangerous it is, is starting to pile up. To begin with,
			sugar is linked with the development of type two diabetes and premature cardiovascular
			disease (Cozma, Sievenpiper, 2013). Independent researchers have come to the
			conclusion there is a strong correlation between fructose containing sugars
			and adverse health effects. Others might argue that this data is only relevant when
			sugar is consumed in high amounts; which is fairly true. However, the individuals who
			make this claim overlook the fact the safe amount of sugar recommended by research is far
			lower than what the average person is eating. In other words, that argument does not apply
			to the vast majority of Americans, because most Americans are consuming high amounts of added
			sugar. A study conducted in 2008, found that the average person consumes roughly 76.7 grams of
			added sugar per day (Gunnars, 2015). 76.7 grams seems like a small amount right? 76.7 grams is
			exactly the opposite of a small amount. According to the American Heart Association, the
			maximum amount of added sugars to be consumed by men and women are 37.5 grams and 25 grams a
			day respectively (Gunnars, 2015). Obviously the American Heart Association is setting these
			standards for a reason; their purpose is to help inform and protect consumers health. With that
			said, who is to say that those maximum's were not influenced by a threat from the Sugar Association;
			a topic mentioned previously in this essay. Perhaps the maximum amount of added sugar per day was set
			at a far lower number, and the numbers released were a compromise with the Sugar Association. To put
			it bluntly, 37.5 grams of added sugar per day might still be too much to maintain excellent
			health. Now that it is clear that most Americans eat added sugar in high amounts, the effects
			of such poor diet decisions can be discussed. A study in 2014 published in the Journal of the
			American Medical Association, concluded that people who get 25% of their calories from sugar,
			are twice as likely to die from heart disease (Milbank, 2015). No wonder there has been talk
			of the similarities between the tobacco and sugar industry. It seems as though sugar could be
			just as harmful to the human body as a cigarette. Furthermore, sugar is linked with a growing
			rate of diabetes. The amount of added sugar per capita in 1980 was 120 lbs, which rose to 132 lbs
			in 2010 (Taubes, 2012). In conjunction, the percentage of Americans with diabetes has risen from
			2.5% in 1980 to 6.8% in 2010 (Taubes, 2012). The data suggests that with the rise of the amount of
			added sugar used, there is a rise in the rate of diabetes. In other words, sugar is linked to diabetes
			with unfaltering statistical support. In addition to the rise of diabetes in America, obesity is
			also a condition linked to sugar. According to Taubes, the rate of obesity rose from 15% of adults
			and 5.5% of children in 1980, to 35.7% and 16.9% respectively in 2010 (2012). An obese individual
			is at risk for increase in the following; "all-causes of death (mortality), high blood pressure (Hypertension),
			high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia), coronary
			heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint),
			sleep apnea and breathing problems, cancer, mental illness" (The Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity).
			An increase in sugar intake leads to an increased risk for extremely grim health complications.
			Disorders and complications are all interconnected to one another; originally stemming from high sugar intake.

			Some might ask, what is the difference between natural sugar and high-fructose corn syrup?
			To begin with, high-fructose corn syrup is a man-made sweetener, and it carries more harmful
			side effects (Hendley, 2007). As previously mentioned, the chemical composition varies slightly
			from natural sugar, or sucrose. Manufacturers use high-fructose corn syrup rather than natural sugar,
			because it is a cheaper substitute that allows for more profits to be made (WHY USE HFCS). Therefore,
			most of the added sugars that are present in foods, are comprised of high-fructose corn syrup. For
			example, high-fructose corn syrup is commonly found in items such as soda, candy, ketchup, and
			other processed junk food. Not only does high-fructose corn syrup carry all of the negative effects
			of natural sugar, but it also has additional characteristics that are a cause for concern. When
			corn goes through the manufacturing process to become high-fructose corn syrup, harmful chemicals
			are introduced (Hyman, 2013). For example, the substance called chloralkali, is used during the
			manufacturing process; chloralkali is known to contain mercury (Hyman, 2013). Therefore high-fructose
			corn syrup contains trace amounts of mercury. It is a well known fact that mercury is a poison to
			the human body, and should not be consumed. In addition, Mark Hyman (Medical Doctor) explains that
			when high-fructose corn syrup is examined with a spectrograph, unidentifiable chemicals
			(with unidentifiable properties) are discovered (2013). Common sense tells us that it is not a bright
			idea to consume unknown substances, with unknown risk factors. Also, according to Dr. Hyman, the
			fructose and glucose in high-fructose corn syrup are not bonded together; which means the fructose
			goes directly into the liver (2013). According to Peter Kovacic and Ratnasamy Somanathan: "When
			consumed in large amounts, fructose promotes the same dose-dependent toxic effects as ethanol,
			promoting hypertension, hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver
			disease" (2013). Since fructose is the main contributor to health problems, it makes sense to say that
			a product with a high percentage of fructose is the cause of the majority of health risks. Natural sugar
			is harmful enough as it is, but high-fructose corn syrup (as stated previously) has a higher percentage
			of fructose and therefore is even more harmful.
		</p>


		<p>
			High-fructose corn syrup is produced using genetically modified corn. The problem with genetically
			modified corn, as with any GMO, is that it has additional health risks. GMO stands for genetically
			modified organism. GMO's are created by artificially adding a foreign gene into the DNA of an organism.
			Approximately 88 percent of all the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified (Kelly, 2012).
			This means that it is almost certain, that high-fructose corn syrup is produced using GMO corn.
			So what are the additional risks involved by using GMO corn? To begin with, GM foods have a chance
			to become toxic after gene insertion; because the new gene is inserted randomly, it could form a
			new substance that is toxic (GE Food and Your Health). In other words, the genetic modification of
			corn could produce a dangerous mutation. In addition, these new GM foods do not undergo any FDA testing
			to ensure its safety (GE Food and Your Health). With a process that produces potentially harmful effects,
			rigorous testing must be a necessary step for approval. Furthermore, GM corn has the potential to carry
			allergens from other foods (GE Food and Your Health). In other words, the trait of causing allergic reactions
			could spread to corn, and cause many individuals to become ill. Take for example a scenario where genes
			from peanuts were added to the DNA of corn. Now imagine an individual with a peanut allergy proceeding to
			eat that GM corn. In a scenario where allergens from the peanut transfers over to the corn, this individual
			would find themselves in a potentially life threatening allergic reaction. It should also be mentioned that
			an entirely new allergen could be formed in the process of making a GMO; a newly formed protein could cause
			allergic reactions (GE Food and Your Health). Thinking about the future, when 100% of crops become GM, this
			means that every single piece of corn could develop a lethal allergen. There is already a problem that exists
			with corn today; GM corn contains a Bt-toxin that causes allergic symptoms (Health Risks). With time, the
			Bt-toxin could become more dangerous, or perhaps a more harmful toxin will take its place. GM food also has
			the potential to change the way an individual reacts to non-GM foods. Studies performed on rats, where the
			rats were fed GM foods, revealed that the GM foods caused the rats to have immune reactions to non-GM food
			(Health Risks). So essentially by consuming high-fructose corn syrup, there is a risk that an individual will
			react adversely with normally non-harmful food. GM products also run the risk of making bacteria resistant
			to antibiotics (GE Food and Your Health). This occurs because antibiotic resistant DNA is inserted into the
			GM food and then has the potential to be "picked up" by bacteria (GE Food and Your Health). In summation,
			the bacteria has the potential to become resistant to antibiotics, leaving people vulnerable to sickness.
			Aside from the actual GM food itself, perhaps the greatest risk stems from the herbicides used in conjunction.
			Herbicides are used to eliminate all plants, except for the GM plant that has a resistance to it. As with any
			harmful chemical, it is not wise to ingest. Unfortunately for the consumers of high-fructose corn syrup, these
			herbicides are left on the plants as they are harvested and then processed. The most common herbicide is
			Roundup, and it covers a large majority of the GM corn in America. Roundup contamination is just another
			reason why high-fructose corn syrup is detrimental to the health of individuals who consume it. In actual
			fact, Roundup is linked to, "sterility, hormone disruption, birth defects, and cancer" (10 Reasons to Avoid GMOs).
			It seems as though almost every possible side effect is linked to high-fructose corn syrup, one way or the other.
		</p>


		<p>
			In summary, the sugar industry is nothing but a deceptive money making machine. The sugar industry does not
			care about the health of the general populace. Profits are the only thing present in the minds of the sugar
			industry's leaders. Chemical similarity between sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup is the only shred of evidence
			that is keeping the sugar industry from being realized as criminals; even that piece of evidence is nonsense, as
			it falls into the category of an oversimplification logical fallacy. Furthermore, the deceptive tactics of the
			sugar industry have been in use since the 1970's. Public relations has kept the sugar industry afloat with its
			use of propaganda. Show-casing its power, it has successfully black-mailed government agencies such as the World
			Health Organization. However, keeping the mouths of government agencies shut was not enough for the sugar industry
			and its allies. Imprecise research was, and still is, conducted by bribed scientists; these "in company" researchers
			received hefty contribution from big name corporations, who just so happen to have a stake in the selling of
			sugary products. The sugar industry continues to throw up a cloud of smoke to hide, because it realizes that there
			is an overwhelming amount of evidence starting to pile-up. Added sugar is toxic is every sense imaginable, and
			unfortunately, Americans are consuming far too much than is considered safe. It is linked to countless harmful effects,
			including; obesity, type 2 diabetes, premature cardiovascular disease, stroke etc. Natural added sugar is harmful
			enough as it is, but high-fructose corn syrup adds another dimension to the potential danger. As the name implies,
			high-fructose corn syrup is comprised of a larger amount of fructose than its natural counterpart sucrose. Extensive
			research has been conducted on the effects of high levels of fructose in the human body and the results show a positive
			correlation to disease. 90 million Americans are affected by fatty liver disease; a disease that is triggered with a
			high consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (Hyman, 2013). Last but not least, high-fructose corn syrup is produced
			using genetically modified (GM) corn. GM crops alone are linked to many harmful and or potential effects. Not only is
			the GM crop harmful in itself, but the herbicides used in conjunction with GMO's pose an enormous threat to the health of consumers.
		</p>


		<p>
			In conclusion, the sugar industry is a corrupt entity that seeks only to hide the important truth about the harmful
			effects of sugar. Specifically today, high-fructose corn syrup is the sugar industry's main vessel of corruption.
			In order to prevent the advancement of the sugar industry's agenda, there must be a movement predicated on the
			enlightenment of how to remain a healthy individual. It is not too late for the people to take back control of their
			own health. Perhaps one day, moral justice will reign supreme over the sugar industry. Until then however, the best
			option is the informative one.

In fact 80 percent of American adults are conscious of their weight and what they eat (Calorie Control Council, 2010).

<p>	Throughout the history of the sugar industry's existence, deception has been their greatest ally. The sugar industry has a whole department devoted to the manipulation of their consumer perceived identity; corporations call this department "Public Relations." The Sugar industry's public relations department has been using tactics that are eerily similar to that of what the tobacco industry has used (Huff et al. 71). Beginning in the 1970's, the sugar industry has implemented sponsored research, censorship, and bribes in order to maintain its profits. Scientific research seems like it would be a great way to solve this whole dilemma, however all scientific research is not created equal. According to Kelly Crowe, researchers hired by the sugar industry received money from big name companies including; Coca-Cola, Hershey, General Foods, General Mills and Nabisco (2013).

It is safe to assume that the conclusions provided from these researchers were influenced by the large amounts of money they received. In other words, researchers were bribed to produce outcomes in favor of the sugar industry's profit. Alas, the deception does not stop with invalid research. Censorship of the media is one of the tools the sugar industry uses to retain a favorable image. During the 1970's, and even today, the sugar industry would forcefully attack anyone who intended to inform the public on the dangers of sugar (Crowe, 2013). In replacement of the media that the industry censored, they implemented misinformation tactics. A specific example included in Kelly Crowe's article, shows a 1970's television ad in which sugar was depicted as a healthier alternative to an apple, and that consuming high amounts of sugar before dinner would prevent overeating (2013). Common sense tells us that this is absolutely false, but in the 1970's it fooled many unsuspecting consumers. Unfortunately the spread of misinformation has not come to an end; although it is not as blatantly false as in the 1970's. Today there is a campaign being run by the Corn Refiners Association. A simple Google search with anything related to high-fructose corn syrup, will present a sponsored link that leads to a website in which misinformation is exhibited. On most of the websites that are sponsored by the Corn Refiners Association, it is stated that High-fructose corn syrup is a natural product. High-fructose corn syrup is not a natural product; a more in depth analysis will be presented in the coming pages of this essay. The Corn Refiners Association also claims that high-fructose corn syrup is safe; again this statement is not accurate. After these websites lull the consumer into their web of lies, it then lists several industrial advantages to high-fructose corn syrup. They list advantages such as; helps mouth feel, browns baked goods, use as a preservative, retains moisture, and controls boiling and melting points (About High Fructose Corn Syrup). It is obvious that the Corn Refiners Association is only interested in securing profits, and will spread lies about health concerns to do so. According to Gary Taubes and Cristen Couzens, the sugar industry spent approximately 3.4 million dollars (in today's money) on public relations annually during the 1970's (2012). If the sugar industry did not have anything to hide, why would they spend such a great deal of money? Thinking logically here, the sugar industry will do anything to secure its profits; which means that the 3.4 million dollars that was spent on public relations was a decision that had a greater benefit than it did a cost. In fact, the decision to spend millions of dollars on deception earned the Sugar Association the Silver Anvil; a public relations award (Crowe, 2013). Furthermore, the sugar lobby has pressured the government to remain neutral regarding sugar regulations. Andy Briscoe, the head of the Sugar Association and sugar lobby, wrote to the advisory committee attempting to persuade them that sugar is not the cause of health problems (Milbank, 2015). As absurd as it sounds, this technique used by the sugar lobby actually works on government organizations. The one safe-guard that consumers have is tainted by the sugar lobby's efforts. Another example of the sugar lobby's foul agenda occurred in 2003. In 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) was scheduled to release a report on health strategies, which included lowering sugar consumption (Huff, 71). In response the proposed release of the report, the Sugar Association threatened  to, "exercise every avenue available . . . including asking congressional appropriators to challenge future [WHO] funding" (Huff et al. 71). It seems as though the sugar industry black-mailed the World Health Organization. Seeing as how black-mailing is a federal offense, there is no limit to what the sugar industry will do to secure its profits. In summary, the sugar industry uses; tainted reports from "in company" researchers, censorship of the media, ad campaigns, and lobbyist tactics to maintain a positive public image. So why is it that the sugar industry is putting forth a substantial effort in public relations? It is almost as if they are trying to hide something.</p>

<p>	Sugar has been scientifically researched for a considerable time now, and the evidence proving how dangerous it is, is starting to pile up. To begin with, sugar is linked with the development of type two diabetes and premature cardiovascular disease (Cozma, Sievenpiper, 2013). Independent researchers have come to the conclusion there is a strong correlation between fructose containing sugars and adverse health effects. Others might argue that this data is only relevant when sugar is consumed in high amounts; which is fairly true. However, the individuals who make this claim overlook the fact the safe amount of sugar recommended by research is far lower than what the average person is eating. In other words, that argument does not apply to the vast majority of Americans, because most Americans are consuming high amounts of added sugar. A study conducted in 2008, found that the average person consumes roughly 76.7 grams of added sugar per day (Gunnars, 2015). 76.7 grams seems like a small amount right? 76.7 grams is exactly the opposite of a small amount. According to the American Heart Association, the maximum amount of added sugars to be consumed by men and women are 37.5 grams and 25 grams a day respectively (Gunnars, 2015). Obviously the American Heart Association is setting these standards for a reason; their purpose is to help inform and protect consumers health. With that said, who is to say that those maximum's were not influenced by a threat from the Sugar Association; a topic mentioned previously in this essay. Perhaps the maximum amount of added sugar per day was set at a far lower number, and the numbers released were a compromise with the Sugar Association. To put it bluntly, 37.5 grams of added sugar per day might still be too much to maintain excellent health. Now that it is clear that most Americans eat added sugar in high amounts, the effects of such poor diet decisions can be discussed. A study in 2014 published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded that people who get 25% of their calories from sugar, are twice as likely to die from heart disease (Milbank, 2015). No wonder there has been talk of the similarities between the tobacco and sugar industry. It seems as though sugar could be just as harmful to the human body as a cigarette. Furthermore, sugar is linked with a growing rate of diabetes. The amount of added sugar per capita in 1980 was 120 lbs, which rose to 132 lbs in 2010 (Taubes, 2012). In conjunction, the percentage of Americans with diabetes has risen from 2.5% in 1980 to 6.8% in 2010 (Taubes, 2012). The data suggests that with the rise of the amount of added sugar used, there is a rise in the rate of diabetes. In other words, sugar is linked to diabetes with unfaltering statistical support. In addition to the rise of diabetes in America, obesity is also a condition linked to sugar. According to Taubes, the rate of obesity rose from 15% of adults and 5.5% of children in 1980, to 35.7% and 16.9% respectively in 2010 (2012). An obese individual is at risk for increase in the following; "all-causes of death (mortality), high blood pressure (Hypertension), high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia), coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint), sleep apnea and breathing problems, cancer, mental illness" (The Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity). An increase in sugar intake leads to an increased risk for extremely grim health complications. Disorders and complications are all interconnected to one another; originally stemming from high sugar intake.</p>

<p>	Some might ask, what is the difference between natural sugar and high-fructose corn syrup? To begin with, high-fructose corn syrup is a man-made sweetener, and it carries more harmful side effects (Hendley, 2007). As previously mentioned, the chemical composition varies slightly from natural sugar, or sucrose. Manufacturers use high-fructose corn syrup rather than natural sugar, because it is a cheaper substitute that allows for more profits to be made (WHY USE HFCS). Therefore, most of the added sugars that are present in foods, are comprised of high-fructose corn syrup. For example, high-fructose corn syrup is commonly found in items such as soda, candy, ketchup, and other processed junk food. Not only does high-fructose corn syrup carry all of the negative effects of natural sugar, but it also has additional characteristics that are a cause for concern. When corn goes through the manufacturing process to become high-fructose corn syrup, harmful chemicals are introduced (Hyman, 2013). For example, the substance called chloralkali, is used during the manufacturing process; chloralkali is known to contain mercury (Hyman, 2013). Therefore high-fructose corn syrup contains trace amounts of mercury. It is a well known fact that mercury is a poison to the human body, and should not be consumed. In addition, Mark Hyman (Medical Doctor) explains that when high-fructose corn syrup is examined with a spectrograph, unidentifiable chemicals (with unidentifiable properties) are discovered (2013). Common sense tells us that it is not a bright idea to consume unknown substances, with unknown risk factors. Also, according to Dr. Hyman, the fructose and glucose in high-fructose corn syrup are not bonded together; which means the fructose goes directly into the liver (2013). According to Peter Kovacic and Ratnasamy Somanathan: "When consumed in large amounts, fructose promotes the same dose-dependent toxic effects as ethanol, promoting hypertension, hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease" (2013). Since fructose is the main contributor to health problems, it makes sense to say that a product with a high percentage of fructose is the cause of the majority of health risks. Natural sugar is harmful enough as it is, but high-fructose corn syrup (as stated previously) has a higher percentage of fructose and therefore is even more harmful.</p>

<p>	High-fructose corn syrup is produced using genetically modified corn. The problem with genetically modified corn, as with any GMO, is that it has additional health risks. GMO stands for genetically modified organism. GMO's are created by artificially adding a foreign gene into the DNA of an organism. Approximately 88 percent of all the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified (Kelly, 2012). This means that it is almost certain, that high-fructose corn syrup is produced using GMO corn. So what are the additional risks involved by using GMO corn? To begin with, GM foods have a chance to become toxic after gene insertion; because the new gene is inserted randomly, it could form a new substance that is toxic (GE Food and Your Health). In other words, the genetic modification of corn could produce a dangerous mutation. In addition, these new GM foods do not undergo any FDA testing to ensure its safety (GE Food and Your Health). With a process that produces potentially harmful effects, rigorous testing must be a necessary step for approval. Furthermore, GM corn has the potential to carry allergens from other foods (GE Food and Your Health). In other words, the trait of causing allergic reactions could spread to corn, and cause many individuals to become ill. Take for example a scenario where genes from peanuts were added to the DNA of corn. Now imagine an individual with a peanut allergy proceeding to eat that GM corn. In a scenario where allergens from the peanut transfers over to the corn, this individual would find themselves in a potentially life threatening allergic reaction. It should also be mentioned that an entirely new allergen could be formed in the process of making a GMO; a newly formed protein could cause allergic reactions (GE Food and Your Health). Thinking about the future, when 100% of crops become GM, this means that every single piece of corn could develop a lethal allergen. There is already a problem that exists with corn today; GM corn contains a Bt-toxin that causes allergic symptoms (Health Risks). With time, the Bt-toxin could become more dangerous, or perhaps a more harmful toxin will take its place. GM food also has the potential to change the way an individual reacts to non-GM foods. Studies performed on rats, where the rats were fed GM foods, revealed that the GM foods caused the rats to have immune reactions to non-GM food (Health Risks). So essentially by consuming high-fructose corn syrup, there is a risk that an individual will react adversely with normally non-harmful food. GM products also run the risk of making bacteria resistant to antibiotics (GE Food and Your Health). This occurs because antibiotic resistant DNA is inserted into the GM food and then has the potential to be "picked up" by bacteria (GE Food and Your Health). In summation, the bacteria has the potential to become resistant to antibiotics, leaving people vulnerable to sickness. Aside from the actual GM food itself, perhaps the greatest risk stems from the herbicides used in conjunction. Herbicides are used to eliminate all plants, except for the GM plant that has a resistance to it. As with any harmful chemical, it is not wise to ingest. Unfortunately for the consumers of high-fructose corn syrup, these herbicides are left on the plants as they are harvested and then processed. The most common herbicide is Roundup, and it covers a large majority of the GM corn in America. Roundup contamination is just another reason why high-fructose corn syrup is detrimental to the health of individuals who consume it. In actual fact, Roundup is linked to, "sterility, hormone disruption, birth defects, and cancer" (10 Reasons to Avoid GMOs). It seems as though almost every possible side effect is linked to high-fructose corn syrup, one way or the other.</p>

<p>	In summary, the sugar industry is nothing but a deceptive money making machine. The sugar industry does not care about the health of the general populace. Profits are the only thing present in the minds of the sugar industry's leaders. Chemical similarity between sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup is the only shred of evidence that is keeping the sugar industry from being realized as criminals; even that piece of evidence is nonsense, as it falls into the category of an oversimplification logical fallacy. Furthermore, the deceptive tactics of the sugar industry have been in use since the 1970's. Public relations has kept the sugar industry afloat with its use of propaganda. Show-casing its power, it has successfully black-mailed government agencies such as the World Health Organization. However, keeping the mouths of government agencies shut was not enough for the sugar industry and its allies. Imprecise research was, and still is, conducted by bribed scientists; these "in company" researchers received hefty contribution from big name corporations, who just so happen to have a stake in the selling of sugary products. The sugar industry continues to throw up a cloud of smoke to hide, because it realizes that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence starting to pile-up. Added sugar is toxic is every sense imaginable, and unfortunately, Americans are consuming far too much than is considered safe. It is linked to countless harmful effects, including; obesity, type 2 diabetes, premature cardiovascular disease, stroke etc. Natural added sugar is harmful enough as it is, but high-fructose corn syrup adds another dimension to the potential danger. As the name implies, high-fructose corn syrup is comprised of a larger amount of fructose than its natural counterpart sucrose. Extensive research has been conducted on the effects of high levels of fructose in the human body and the results show a positive correlation to disease. 90 million Americans are affected by fatty liver disease; a disease that is triggered with a high consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (Hyman, 2013). Last but not least, high-fructose corn syrup is produced using genetically modified (GM) corn. GM crops alone are linked to many harmful and or potential effects. Not only is the GM crop harmful in itself, but the herbicides used in conjunction with GMO's pose an enormous threat to the health of consumers.</p>

<p>	In conclusion, the sugar industry is a corrupt entity that seeks only to hide the important truth about the harmful effects of sugar. Specifically today, high-fructose corn syrup is the sugar industry's main vessel of corruption. In order to prevent the advancement of the sugar industry's agenda, there must be a movement predicated on the enlightenment of how to remain a healthy individual. It is not too late for the people to take back control of their own health. Perhaps one day, moral justice will reign supreme over the sugar industry. Until then however, the best option is the informative one.</p>
